Кто бы ни стал победителем, возможности его будут ограничены, говорят эксперты, опрошенные DW. В Абхазии 24 августа проходят досрочные выборы президента не признанной международным сообществом республики. Толчком к их проведению стали массовые протесты в конце мая 2014 года, в результате которых со своего поста был вынужден уйти действующий президент Абхазии Александр Анкваб. Эксперты называют среди наиболее перспективных кандидатов находящегося в оппозиции политика Рауля Хаджимбу, экс-главу службы безопасности Аслана Бжанию и генерала Мираба Кишмарию, исполняющего обязанности министра обороны.

В 2016 году Роскомнадзор внес методическое пособие историка Андрея Суслова о сталинских репрессиях в список материалов, \"наносящих вред здоровью детей\". Аккредитованные Роскомнадзором эксперты пришли к выводу, что \"воспитательная направленность пособия препятствует усвоению нравственных норм […] и способствует формированию личности с негативной - антиобщественной и антигосударственной - идентичностью\".\\n@highlight\\nВ Германии за сутки выявлено более 100 новых заражений коронавирусом\\n@highlight\\nТысячи демонстрантов в Гамбурге выступили за прием беженцев\\n@highlight\\nКомментарий: Россия накануне эпидемии - виноватые назначены заранее',\n"," 'Представители Грузии и Южной Осетии согласились провести прямые консультации.
